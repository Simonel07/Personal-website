                <h1>What means whoami?</h1>			
                <p style="text-indent: 5rem;">Huh, it's funny, you know? We live in a world where we don't know who we are. Even if we learn in school how we can discover ourselves or what our parents taught us, what they don't tell us is that we change. So, maybe I discovered myself at 14 years old, but I changed a lot from 14 to 15, and I saw that I did not know myself anymore. What next? Well, rediscover me. How to do it? Good luck! Because everyone is different, I don't know how you can do it, but I will let you know below how I did it. But let's get back to what is "whoami" for a bit. Whoami is a Linux command that tells you ... who you are. Yeah, that's all. Nothing fancy, no rocket science, or something too hard to understand. And like I told you before, we need to rediscover ourselves frequently, as the computer needs this and everything that exists in this universe, at some point, needs to know who it is. <br>
				</p>
				<h1>Who was I?</h1>
				<p style="text-indent: 5rem;">I had this happen multiple times when I wrote this command inside the command line of my brain. The first time I did this was when I was 12 years old, and after that, I did not do that for more than 4 years. In my first year of high school, I decided to get out of my box and escape from being alone. In less than a month, I became one of the most popular people in town(not just in my high school). I had a lot of friends, and I also got a girlfriend, but everything ended when I realized they used me for my popularity. I did not ask myself yet that big question because I wanted to be back in my box and to be alone, so that happened. After another year, at 17 years old, I realized that I did not know who I was. So I took my time and I escaped from being alone by just discovering science. From that moment, I started studying physics, astronomy, astrophysics, computer science, and mathematics. If you were in high school in those days, you would probably find me in the library reading some old scientific books, working on my first game or writing some complex code for my robotic team. So many people and teachers began to approach me, and looking back, I realize they were fascinated by me and how quickly I changed. When I thought that I had endless power, the pandemic arrived. So I found myself alone again, but guess what? At that moment, I knew a lot about astronomy, so I just lost myself in a lot of night thoughts. And that was good for me because I found who I am and I realized that I am not just some simple person, so I had to do something. <br></p>
				<p style="text-indent: 5rem;">Knowing that I do not have experience, I started to learn and work on small projects and also to focuss on my faculty admission. During the days of examination for faculty I had the biggest breakdown that I had in my hole life yet. I did not was at the level I wanted and I also beleived that I will not be enter to faculty, I was planning on coming back home and starting to work in agriculture, but somehow I was admited. After that moment I did the same thing, I checked if I was any more who I thought I were. And I found out that I was not but who was I?... I felt powerful, I realized that my hard work was good and I asked myself: "what's next?" <br></p>
				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
				<p style="text-indent: 5rem;">My next steps on a professional level you can see in my experience section, but now that I managed to do this exercise of whoami, I get used to doing it every one or two months. As you probably already know me, I am a quiet person and I am not that one who always has the answers or the right questions, but I found with this exercise that I am that person who is watching from the shadows and loves to be alone, loves to think a lot about facts and about everything that people around me do. I am quiet in public but I never stop talking in private. Why that? Well, just because I don't want to be someone important in the eyes of the people, I don't care. I keep my thoughts to myself and when the right time comes, I use them in my favor. I am not talking too much with people who do not matter to me, but you will probably think that you were there. But think about what I told you. If I told you, it is the first time I told you something. That is because you are really important to me and I care about you. But don't worry, I don't want back something. I passed that temptation a long time ago. <br></p>
				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p style="text-indent: 5rem;">I am writing this in the night between day two and three of ROSPIN Level Three, and there were some people I met in person, not just online behind the screen. That helped me a lot, and again they are making me think about who I am. I suggest you do this exercise, and you will discover who you really are. Put everything on paper and read it after a good sleep. Do the same for one or two days. Make time for yourself to organize your thoughts. I do this very often, so I know what I am talking about. I hope that my story about rediscovering myself and who I think I am right now has helped me a lot and motivates me to work and work not for me but for people. I want you to let go with a melody from Steve Aoki: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vt4Tq89R8u0" target="_blank">Just Hold On</a>. There is a lovely sequence that made me want to not sleep, and that is "Where do you go when your story's done?" You can be who you were or who you'll become. "</p>
